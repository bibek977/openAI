The 2022 Ballon d'Or (lit. '2022 Golden Ball') was the 66th annual presentation of the Ballon d'Or, presented by France Football, recognising the best footballers in the world during the 2021–22 season. For the first time in the history of the award, it was given based on the results of the season, instead of the calendar year.[1] The nominees for the ceremony were announced on 12 August 2022,[2] and the ceremony was held on 17 October.[3]

The Ballon d'Or was awarded to French international Karim Benzema, who was one of five players from Real Madrid's UEFA Champions League–winning team nominated for the award; and Spanish international Alexia Putellas claimed the Ballon d'Or Féminin, following her successful domestic campaign with Barcelona.[4] In the other award categories, Gavi was given the Kopa Trophy, Thibaut Courtois won the Yashin Trophy, Robert Lewandowski was presented the newly named Gerd Müller Trophy,[5] Sadio Mané was awarded the inaugural Sócrates Award,[6] and Manchester City claimed the Club of the Year award.[4][7]
